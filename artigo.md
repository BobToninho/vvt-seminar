# Introduction

The paper proposes an communicating-automata-based model to formally verify of single page and multi page web applications. The authors propose an ``In'' operator for LTL in order to simplify LTL. This doesn't add expressiveness, but makes LTL formulas in this specific domain more succint.

The proposed approach is dynamic and black-box, also known as run-time verification. This is so that the approach is not dependant on the source code being accessible, and assumes only the request-response flow is observable.

# Automata-based modeling of web applications

Disclaimer: this is not an exaustive testing like traditional model checking, but should be considered as ``passive testing''.

## Modeling approach



## Single window browsing
## Multiple window browsing

# LTL and the "In" operator

In order to represent more succintly LTL formulas in the domain of web applications, the authors extend the LTL syntax with the **In** operator.
